  This package contains 
  domain objects relevant for the tele medicine domain.

  <p>
    The central domain object is the <b>TeleObservation</b> that
    represents a patient's measurement of some vital signs at home.
  </p>
  <p>
    The present domain model is greatly simplified, only having a
    single measurement type, namely blood pressure. A blood pressure
    measurement contains two measured quantities (instances
    of <b>ClinicalQuantity</b>): Systolic and Diastolic pressure, both
    measured in mm(Hg).
  </p>

  <p>
    The interface <b>TeleMed</b> represents the central role in our
    system in that it supports storing tele observations and executing
    queries for tele observations.
